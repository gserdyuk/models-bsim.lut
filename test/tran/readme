Examples:

Comparator
----------
taken from http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsim3/circuits.html
original circuit and results are in ./orig
esimated andf confirmed simulation results are in ./golden
simulation script, circuit file are comprt-l2, comprt-l2.gckt

important for comparator - have reltol=0.1

comprt-l1/ comprt-l1.gckt - simulation w/o FET charge caclulation
