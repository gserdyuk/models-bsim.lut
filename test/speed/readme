this test compares speed of execution of regular BSIM code and LUT code

method:
1) read / create reasonable ckt and model objects
2) execute b3load N times (standard/ nocap/ lut)
3) measure time, calculate average

NB. if BSIM3tnom==0 execution time increases SIGNIFICATLY (60 times) due to interruptions "div by zero"

optimization made, most functions in LUT_rr.cc were substituted with #define
now speed up is ~ 40 % ( lut time is 40% less than normal time)

to make test:
>make 
>20run
